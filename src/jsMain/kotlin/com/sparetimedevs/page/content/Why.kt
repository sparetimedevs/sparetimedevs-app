const val WHY_PARAGRAPH =
"""We enjoy trying out new technologies and ideas. Doing so together is even more fun. Working together on projects means faster development, which means that we see faster results from our work.
Another benefit of doing these projects together, is that we can learn from each other. We can challenge each other. And we can uphold each other to certain standards, something which is hard when doing a project alone.
Last but not least, we can share the costs of the infrastructure, which makes it cheaper to do these kind of projects that do not generate value in the sense of money. This also means that it is more affordable to not compromise on architectural and infrastructural decisions so that we can make similar design decision as we would make in our paid endeavours.
